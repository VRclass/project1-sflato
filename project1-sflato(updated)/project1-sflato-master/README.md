## Project Description 

In this project you will model your favorite VR space to spend time. Given time constrains you will need to choose the level of detail and size of your effort. The main considerations are that you must be able to navigate the space, and you must have sound, navigation, and three objects that can be interacted with by the user of the VR device.

## Project Repository 
[GitHub repo]()

## Storyline
Write down a few paragraphs of narrative (200-250 words) that introduce your storyline. Introduce the back-story. Describe what happens in the environment – what is happening, where is the user placed at the beginning of the environment, what is the user expected to see, hear and touch.

Discuss the elements you plan to use to generate the feelings and emotions presented by the environment. What was the feeling at the beginning of the experience? What techniques do you plan to use to change that to the feeling of the experience? Try to describe the setting of your environment.


What does the user:
- see 👁
- hear 👂🏼
- smell 👃🏾
- think 🧠
- feel 😭😍
- interact with 👋🏻

How does the experience evolve? If your VR experience does not have an actual storyline, jot down the background for how you developed the idea for your piece. What was in your mind? Why do you think your idea is a good one? What was your inspiration? Remember your work will have a storyboard even if you are not developing a narrative type experience.

# Project Requirements

There are multiple required components to each class project, which are described in more detail below. Each project will require the following:

- Project Proposal [10%]()
- Project Execution [70%]()
- Project Report [20%]()

The contribution to the final project grade is listed behind each section and each section is required to receive a passing grade for the project.

## Project Proposal [10%]()

Projects require some planning, this includes a summary of the project, the goals of your project, and a plan on how you will achieve the goals. 

Your proposal should include the following:

 - Title of the project
 - Author
 - Abstract/summary of what do you want to achieve and why, this should only be a few sentences long and will be used to guide the evaluation of the project
 - Resources needed (e.g. Unity and HTC Vive, Google Cardboard and Unreal Engine)
 - Plan on what you want to do with milestones and dates, it can be a simple bulleted list 

Fill out the [VR Project1 Proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y0hJCX5gd6_Hs57LjUked7Q5N0Ke7pcaSj961Pqz_gY/prefill) by **Firday March 8th, 8pm (you will have time to work on it during class time)**.

## Project Execution [70%]() 
> Your proposal and storyboards need to be **approved** by Brenda, in order to start implementing your project. You will get feedback by Saturday October 13th.

Implementation of project is the execution of the milestones to achieve the project goal(s).  As you develop your project, you will be applying an iterative process that will likely require the adjustment of milestones and goals.  These adjustments should be captured in your projects final report.
